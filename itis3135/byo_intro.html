                        <label>Personal Background: <input name="personal-background" type="text" value="Was born in NC, at age 4 I encountered an AVM rupture which set me back and made learning much more difficult. I had gone through years of therapy and was able to successfully recover though some things can still be more challenging for me. I have always been interested in computers and the science behind them since I was a kid. During the summer of my sophmore year of high school I began taking Computer Science courses provided by the University of Michigan off of Coursera. I then took a Python and Java course during my junior and senior year of high school. I noticed UNC Charlotte has a great Comp Sci program so I decided to only apply for that college. Though during my senior year I did start having a lot of interest in cars as I had gotten my first car. Though I did have some thoughts of going into a trade school for automotive but I decided I still wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science."></label>

                        <label>Background In Web Development: <input name="web-background" type="text" value="My current background in this subject is I did play around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript when I was building a weather website for fun and practice. Though the practice was more focussed on me working on my Python skills and Flask. But I have been wanting to work on the front-end a lot now and so I feel good with the past knowledge and getting the full experience with this course."></label>
                        <label>Primary Computer Platform: <input name="comp-platform" type="text" value="I work with both Windows, Mac, and Rasbian. Though I prefer Mac because they make everything have round corners and make it clean in my opinion. I also like how Terminal is very similar to Linux CLI and everytime on a new Windows I have to install Ubuntu CLI because I can't take PowerShell."></label>

                    </a>
                    <p>This site is some random website I found by clicking a find random page button and this is what it gave me. It's a pug in a rug illusion and moves with wherever your pointer moves.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C</b>
                            <p>The contrast on this website is not good because the background moves with the mouse and makes it look like an illusion. This makes any user get very dizzy and or confused and wanting to not use this website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>R</b>
                            <p>The repetition on this website is inconsistent due to the lack of functionality. The page has no header or main and only has a footer making repetition to not really be a thing on this website.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>A</b>
                            <p>The allignment is not too bad on this page because not much text is on there. The only text on the footer is layed out normally and readable enough.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>P</b>
                            <p>This page proximity is not good because there is not content in either the header or the main and only containing a background image that takes up the entire viewport.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </a>
                    <p>This website is Carvana which is an automotive trading site. You can purchase pre-owned vehicles or sell your own vehicles.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C</b>
                            <p>The contrast on Carvana is mainly white and blue which gives a cool feeling as many images of vehicles can be all different colors. This allows users to better view the vehicles and their true color instead of having something like red.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>R</b>
                            <p>The repetition on Carvana is very consistent. Every vehicle has their own section of boxes containing the information/data of each vehicle.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>A</b>
                            <p>The alignment is well layed out with all vehicles following a grid like structure so users can just scan through the vehicles row by row.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>P</b>
                            <p>The proximity is consistent throughout every car information is held in its proper sections and spaced out from others. The filter buttons and forms are also put onto the left side while pushing the car images to the center right.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </a>
                    <p>This website is a forum for any Audi owners. It provides anyone to create a thread of any audi question and others can respond and provide information or knowledge to the question.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C</b>
                            <p>The contrast is very bad. Most of the page has no colors just plain white and gray. A lot of the seperate categories are left white making it very hard as it already blends in with the white background.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>R</b>
                            <p>There is proper repetition as all comments are constantly stacked above in the same type of section.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>A</b>
                            <p>The alignment is ok. It does have everything run vertically in a block like structure. But they have adds that can just pop up in-between the grid making it much more difficult.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>P</b>
                            <p>The proximity is very bad and probably the worst part. Everything is way too small and when making it very small that should then provide a lot of space. But instead even though its small everything is clustered together making it impossible to work with.</p>
                        </li>

                        <h3 id="cssfont">CSS Font Styles</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>This webpage is CSS font style cheatsheet. I use this as a bookmark to always look at the font styles because those I just can't remember. But I specifically use this site because of the way it is super easy to find the fonts and to choose from one.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>C</b>
                            <p>The contrast is very good and consistent. It has a light blue background with a boxed in body making it look like its stacked upon another. They also added a box shadow effect which really help locating the center view of the page.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>R</b>
                            <p>Each font on the page is consistent using a grid like structure providing the font name an then an axample to the right.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>A</b>
                            <p>The alignment is very good. It has all proper header, main and footer it also has all sections of the page labeled and all text is from left to right.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>P</b>
                            <p>Proximity is perfect on this page. I think everything is very well spaced out and there is still so much room on the page. All different sections on the page are well held together and spaced apart from other sections.</p>
                        </li>

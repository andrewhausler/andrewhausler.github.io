            <ul>
                <li>Personal Background: <p class="intro-descriptions">Was born in NC, at age 4 I encountered an AVM rupture which set me back and made learning much more difficult. I had gone through years of therapy and was able to successfully recover though some things can still be more challenging for me. I have always been interested in computers and the science behind them since I was a kid. During the summer of my sophmore year of high school I began taking Computer Science courses provided by the University of Michigan off of Coursera. I then took a Python and Java course during my junior and senior year of high school. I noticed UNC Charlotte has a great Comp Sci program so I decided to only apply for that college. Though during my senior year I did start having a lot of interest in cars as I had gotten my first car. Though I did have some thoughts of going into a trade school for automotive but I decided I still wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.</p></li>
                <li>Professional Background: <p class="intro-descriptions">When I turned 16 I applied to Regal Cinemas and have been working there for the last 3-4 years. I am currently still working there but only during holidays and the summer.</p></li>
                <li>Academic Background: <p class="intro-descriptions">I currently have my high school diploma and I am currently a student at UNC Charlotte CCI and working towards my concentration in Software Engineering.</p></li>
                <li>Background in this Subject: <p class="intro-descriptions">My current background in this subject is I did play around with HTML, CSS, and Javascript when I was building a weather website for fun and practice. Though the practice was more focussed on me working on my Python skills and Flask. But I have been wanting to work on the front-end a lot now and so I feel good with the past knowledge and getting the full experience with this course.</p></li>
                <li>Primary Computer Platform: <p class="intro-descriptions">I work with both Windows, Mac, and Rasbian. Though I prefer Mac because they make everything have round corners and make it clean in my opinion. I also like how Terminal is very similar to Linux CLI and everytime on a new Windows I have to install Ubuntu CLI because I can't take PowerShell.</p></li>
                <li>Courses I'm Taking and Why:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="courses">ITCS-3112 - Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems: <p class="intro-descriptions">Taking this course because it is part of my major and I get to use my Java skills to build an application.</p></li>
                        <li class="courses">ITIS-3135 - Web-Based Application Design and Development: <p class="intro-descriptions">This course is also part of my major and it's the first course I have taken for front-end development. Plus I went to CPCC where I met Professor von Briesen so I made sure to take this course he teaches at UNC Charlotte.</p></li>
                        <li class="courses">GEOG-1501 - Global Social Science: World Geography: <p class="intro-descriptions">Taking this course because I need to get it done for general education. It also seems not too bad to just learn about globalization.</p></li>
                        <li class="courses">MATH-1242 - Calculus II: <p class="intro-descriptions">If it wasn't required I wouldnâ€™t be taking it. Was good with math until Calc came in and now it's a struggle but I am making it through.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Funny/Interesting Items to Remember me by: <p class="intro-descriptions">I am a huge Audi enthusiast. I currently own an Audi a4 b8 S-line. I live in Huntersville so each weekend I head back home to drive, wash, and modify my car.</p></li>
                <li>I'd also like to Share: <p class="intro-descriptions">I love talking about anything Comp Sci or automotive related</p></li>

                    <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is used in all web application you see whenever you are viewing the web.</p>
                    <p>HTML by itself is a static markup language, meaning that all content remands unchanged and whatever data is on that file remains and doesn't change. The only way it will change is if you send a new request to the webserver that is running on the site you are using.</p>

                        <p>HTML is much more laid back with structuring a webpage but the browser that the webpage will run is not. It's important to follow the correct structure in developing a webpage to run as it should.</p>
                        <p>Every HTML page should always begin with <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>. The doctype allows your browser to know you want to use up-to-date HTML and to not use any legacy versions.</p>
                        <p>These brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code> are called angle brackets. Angle brackets are used to define the HTML tag you want to use when laying out your HTML. There are many different types of tags headings, paragraphs, images, etc. They all allow the browser to identify your layout.</p>

                    <section id="structure">
                        <h4>Structure</h4>
                        <p>After the DOCTYPE you can create the HTML tag <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code>. The HTML tag is the root element in creating an HTML page.</p>
                        <p>The HTML tag also allows the browser to recognize it's working with an HTML file.</p>
                        <p>The beginning HTML tag <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> represents the start of the HTML page and the ending tag <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> represents the end of the HTML page.</p>
                        <p>Finally setting the language property of the HTML <code>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</code> is recommended as it helps search engines understand the page's language as well as working with translation tools.</p>

                        <h4>Metadata</h4>
                        <p>The next tag after the HTML tag is the head tag. The head provides data and information to the browser and search engines about the document.</p>
                        <p>Inside of the head element it can contain a meta, title, favicon, link, etc. The meta tag is a void tag that takes the character encoding property <code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>.</p>
                        <p>The next meta is used for setting the view of the page. Webpages on many different devices can come out looking very different by the sizes of the device screen. When setting the viewport according to the devices screen size, allows for easier viewing and reading.</p>

                        <p>The title tag is used for setting the name of the page. This name you set will be viewable on the tab of the page.</p>
                        <p>Another commonly used tag in the head element is the link tag <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>. This tag is a void tag and used to link external resources such as linking you CSS stylesheet.</p>

                        <p>The body is where the actual information on your webpage goes.</p>
                        <p>There are three important parts that should be inside of the body. There should always be a header, main, and a footer.</p>
                        <p>The header is the upper most part of the page. This part of the page should consist of some sort of title of the page and a navigation part connected all the other pages.</p>
                        <p>In the middle of the page there should be the main information/content meant for that page.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the final piece is the footer which can be used for providing external sources as well as giving credit to developers, websites, servers, or any application thats a part of your website.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to work with static HTML files to make it more interactive.</p>
                    <p>With JavaScript you can simply add the path to your script file and include that in the HTML. Then you can immediately start calling and assigning all tags, classes, and elements.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript is very similar to other languages out their like Python, Java, etc. It has very similar data types and syntax as well as having re-assigning variables and non-re-assigning variables.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript also includes its own implementation of conditionals, loops, objects, and arrays, making it a flexible and powerful language for various programming tasks.</p>

                        <p>When using JavaScript every modern web browser comes with a console which is usually hidden and to access it you need to left click on your mouse and look for a button name "Inspect".</p>
                        <p>The Inspect button allows you to view the code/HTML behind the webpage as well as it's console. When using JavaScript you can print data that you want displayed on the console wether you running conditional tests, input tests, or any form of analyzing the code.</p>
                        <p>To display the code onto the console you use the <code>console.log()</code>.</p>

                        <h4>Data Types</h4>
                        <p>JavaScript consists of eight primary data types. These data types are Number, BigInt, String, Boolean, undefined, null, Symbol, and Object. All the data types are primitive types except the Object.</p>
                        <p>Primitive data types mean that they are the most basic types and the actual value is stored directly in the variable.</p>
                        <p>Non-primitive data types are ones that are mutable and have reference to the memory address to the value and doesn't directly be assigned to the value. This means that it will usually require you to do specific calls onto that reference as the memory could be long with more than one value.</p>
                        <p>For example, in a JavaScript object there may be multiple key and value pairs and to access the desired one you would call the reference with the name of the key which will return the value.</p>

                    <section id="conditions">
                        <h4>Conditions</h4>
                        <p>JavaScript has conditions which are used for handling different scenarios which can lead to different outcomes.</p>
                        <p>The types of conditions that JavaScript has are if, else if, else, switch statements, and ternary operators.</p>
                        <p>The if statement is always the required first condition before you can use a else if or an else. The if checks the first or the only condition you need met.</p>
                        <p>The else if is used when you need another condition if the first one is not met. Then a else can be used when none of the conditions are met then assign this value. When using the else your are requiring for at least one of the conditions to be met.</p>

                        <p>The switch statement works very similarly to the regular conditions like the if, else if, and else. The switch is mainly used for when you have a large amount of conditions and allows for them to reduce the amount of lines resulting in more compact conditions.</p>

                        <p>Finally, the ternary operator is a shorthand way to write a simple if-else statement. It is specifically called "ternary" because it takes three operands.</p>

                        <h4>Loops</h4>
                        <p>There are two main types of loops in JavaScript which are for and while loops. A for loop takes a value which is used as the iterator counter then there is the condition that must be met and lastly the iteration expression that allows for the condition to be met.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>The while loop is much simpler as all it requires is to have a condition and whenever its met it stops then. But you can also make them infinite.</p>
                        <div class="img-btn">
                            <figure>

                        </div>
                        <p>These loops are primarily used for iterating over an array or object as it can be used on anything that has a reference to a large piece of memory that is holding more than one value.</p>
                        <p>It may seem daunting when you hear the term "iteration" or "iterating", you may also here the term "traversing". These terms just mean you are moving through the sections of memory as there are more than one value stored inside so each value needs to be handled once at a time.</p>

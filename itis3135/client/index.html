                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to A Curious Niner! A Curious Niner focuses on teaching the basics of a category of knowledge.</p>
                    <p>This webpage focuses on front-end development basics to potentially offer a quick way of determining wether it interests you and to dive deeper in this concept!</p>

                    <h3>Guidance</h3>
                    <p>A Curious Niner provides simple navigational features inside our webpage. Below the title of our page we have clickable buttons that will redirect you to another page that you would like to view.</p>
                    <p>If you ever get lost and need to return back to the landing page/home page clicking on the title will bring you right back from where you started!</p>
                    <p>On the left side there consists a table of contents navbar that will allow you to access sections of the page. Some pages like this one are not as long as others so may not be needed.</p>
                    <p>You may be noticing a "|" vertical bar in between the left navbar and the main content. This vertical bar is a button that allows you to hide the table of contents if needed. This can help expand the amount of room for the main content when in tighter situations.</p>
                    <p>In the header upper right corner there consists a search bar used for navigating to a specific language like HTML. This will redirect you to that specific page of content if that language exists on this webpage.</p>

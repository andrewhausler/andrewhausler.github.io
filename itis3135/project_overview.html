                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Purpose: </strong>My clients application will be based off of design number 4. Design number 4 is to develop a webpage for a student who would like to learn the basics of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc. The goal is to provide a useful webpage specifically designed towards my clients needs and to allow them to dive into web development. This will allow my client to get a intro start on web-development to determine their interest in this path.</p>
                <p><strong>Intended Users: </strong>The intended users for this website would be any UNC Charlotte student that is currently not enrolled in any web-development focused course. This is to allow these students to get a quick grasp and try to determine if they would like to further continue this path of interest.</p>
                <p><strong>Content Overview: </strong>The overview of the content of the website that I will be developing for my client will consist of a landing page, about page, and language pages. Each language will consist of their own links inside of the navigation bar. Each language page will have the same layouts by containing sections. For example the first section on each page will consist of having a introduction, syntax, main content, examples, etc. Within each one of those pages a navbar will be included for moving down to certain sections of the page because it could be long depending on the content.</p>
